# `sw`

[中文](./README.md) | **English**

`sw`, short for `SimpleWindow`, is a C++ GUI framework for building Windows desktop applications. It provides object-oriented encapsulation of Windows standard controls and is suitable for creating simple desktop applications.

## Features

+ **Based on Windows API**:  
  SimpleWindow is a framework based on the Windows API with no additional dependencies.

+ **Supports Properties**:  
  It implements property syntax similar to C#, allowing for intuitive access and modification of object properties.

+ **High DPI Support**:  
  Native support for high DPI using DIP (Device Independent Pixels) as the default unit of measurement.

+ **Flexible Layout**:  
  Implements a layout system similar to WPF, supporting various layouts such as `GridLayout`, `StackLayout`, `DockLayout`, and more.

+ **Routed Events**:  
  Adopts a routed event mechanism, where events can bubble up from the source control to propagate upwards. Event handlers can be registered on controls at different levels.

## Usage

### Clone the Repository

First, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mzying2001/sw.git
```

#### Method 1: Using Visual Studio

1. Add a reference to the `vs/sw.vcxproj` project in your solution.
2. In your project properties, add the path `sw/inc` to the **Additional Include Directories**.

#### Method 2: Using CMake

1. Add the following to your `CMakeLists.txt`:

    ```cmake
    add_subdirectory(path/to/sw)
    ```

2. Link the `sw` library, for example:

   ```cmake
   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE sw)
   ```

### Using the Single-File Version

A single-file version of `sw` is available in the [single_header](https://github.com/Mzying2001/sw/tree/main/single_header) directory, which is automatically generated by a script. Simply download `sw_all.h` and `sw_all.cpp` and add them to your project to use.

### Using vcpkg

`sw` now supports the [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) package manager, and the package name is `mzying2001-sw`.

1. Install the vcpkg package:

   ```bash
   vcpkg install mzying2001-sw
   ```

2. If you are using CMake, add `sw` to your project:

   ```cmake
   find_package(sw CONFIG REQUIRED)
   target_link_libraries(your_target PRIVATE sw::sw)
   ```

3. Once configured, you can directly include `sw` header files in your project, for example:

   ```cpp
   #include <sw/SimpleWindow.h>
   ```

> [!NOTE]
> All code files in `sw` use UTF-8 encoding. If the file encoding is inconsistent with the system, compiler warnings or errors may occur. It is recommended to add the `/utf-8` compiler option (for MSVC) or `-finput-charset=UTF-8` (for g++/clang) when using them, or manually change the file encoding.

## Quick Start

Here is a SimpleWindow HelloWorld program. For more examples, see [here](https://github.com/Mzying2001/sw/tree/main/examples).

```cpp
#include "SimpleWindow.h"

int WinMain(HINSTANCE, HINSTANCE, LPSTR, INT)
{
    // Create window and button objects
    sw::Window wnd;
    sw::Button btn;

    // Modify the window layout to center the button
    wnd.SetLayout<sw::FillLayout>();

    // Modify the button text by assigning a value to the Text property
    btn.Text = L"Click Me";

    // Add a button click event handler to show a message box when the button is clicked
    btn.AddHandler(sw::ButtonBase_Clicked,
        [](sw::UIElement& sender, sw::RoutedEventArgs& e) {
            sw::MsgBox::Show(L"Hello, SimpleWindow!");
        });

    // Add the control and display the window
    wnd.AddChild(btn);
    return wnd.ShowDialog();
}
```
